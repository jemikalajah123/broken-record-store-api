# CHALLENGE SOLUTION


# Enhancing Search Performance & Scalability  

## ðŸ”¹ Current Issues:  
While optimizing the record store API, I identified key performance bottlenecks:  
- The `findAll()` method was inefficient, loading all records into memory before filtering.  
- Filtering was done in JavaScript instead of MongoDB queries, leading to slow execution.  
- Frequent database queries increased response times and introduced unnecessary latency.  
- Repeated queries for the same data created unnecessary load on the database.  

## âœ… Optimized Solution:  
To address these issues, I implemented the following improvements:  
- **MongoDB Query Filters:** Directly applied query filters in the `find()` method to optimize data retrieval.  
- **Indexing:** Added indexes on `artist`, `album`, `category`, and `format` to speed up searches.  
- **Pagination:** Implemented `limit` and `skip` to efficiently handle large datasets, reducing unnecessary memory consumption.

# Fetching Tracklist Data from MusicBrainz API  

## ðŸ”¹ Current Issues:  
- Previously, the system lacked automatic tracklist fetching from MusicBrainz, requiring manual entry.  
- The `mbid` field was not effectively used to retrieve track information.  

## âœ… Optimized Solution:  
- Implemented automatic tracklist fetching when a record is created or updated with an `mbid`.  
- Stored the retrieved tracklist in the record model for future reference.  
- Enforced uniqueness checks during record creation and updates to maintain data integrity.  

## âœ… Benefits:  
- Reduces manual data entry.  
- Ensures tracklist accuracy and consistency.

# Order System Implementation  

## ðŸ”¹ Requirements Addressed:  
To streamline order management, I implemented:  
- Order placement functionality.  
- Stock validation before processing orders.  
- Automatic stock deduction upon successful order completion.  

## âœ… Benefits:  
- Prevents overselling by ensuring stock availability.  
- Keeps inventory updated in real time.  
- Provides APIs to fetch all orders and retrieve single order details.

# Implementing Caching for Faster Queries  

## ðŸ”¹ Caching Strategy:  
To improve query performance and reduce database load, I integrated **Redis caching** with a **cache-first approach**:  

- **Application-Level Caching:** Frequently accessed records are cached in Redis.  
- **Query Caching Workflow:**  
  1. Check Redis before querying MongoDB.  
  2. If data is found in cache, return it immediately.  
  3. If not found, fetch from MongoDB, store in Redis, and return the result.  

## âœ… Benefits:  
- Reduces database query load.  
- Improves response times for frequently accessed data.  
- Enhances system scalability by leveraging caching mechanisms.

# Restructuring the Project Setup for Scalability & Maintainability  

## ðŸ”¹ Issues with Previous Project Structure:  
- The project structure was not modular, leading to tight coupling of components.  
- External service integrations were scattered across different files, making maintenance difficult.  
- Controllers contained business logic, making them less readable and harder to test.  
- DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) were missing, leading to inconsistent data handling.  
- Imports were messy due to a lack of centralized index files.  

## âœ… Restructured Project Setup:  

### 1. **Modularization:**  
- **Third-Party Module:** Handles all external service integrations (e.g., MusicBrainz API).  
- **Order Module:** Contains order-related controllers, services, and DTOs.  
- **Shared Module:** Includes reusable utilities like HTTP interceptors, response formatters.  

### 2. **Controller Cleanup:**  
- Moved logic into a dedicated **RecordService**, keeping controllers clean.  
- Separated order-related logic into **OrderModule** to ensure single responsibility.  

### 3. **Introduced DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):**  
- Standardized data structures for request and response payloads.  
- Improved validation and type safety, reducing the risk of invalid data processing.  

### 4. **Created Root Index Files:**  
- Each module now has an `index.ts` file to aggregate exports.  
- Simplifies imports and keeps the codebase clean.  

## âœ… Benefits of the New Structure:  
- **Improved Code Readability & Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns makes it easier to manage and extend the application.  
- **Better Scalability:** The modular approach allows new features to be added without disrupting existing functionality.  
- **Easier Testing:** Services and controllers are now independent, making unit testing more straightforward.  
- **Clean & Organized Imports:** The use of root `index.ts` files reduces import clutter and improves maintainability.
